## Notes

- When you create reusable React components, you want to make sure that people use them correctly. The best way to do this is to use TypeScript in your codebase to give you compile-time checking of your code. But if youâ€™re not using TypeScript, you can still use PropTypes to get runtime validation. Between you and me, when I was still doing AngularJS work, I was so envious of this feature, that I tried to build it into AngularJS.
