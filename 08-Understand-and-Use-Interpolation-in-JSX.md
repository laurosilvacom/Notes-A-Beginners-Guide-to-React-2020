## Notes

- Now that we have a good foundation on React elements, JSX, custom elements, and props, letâ€™s write a React component that has some conditional logic in it to explore the interpolation characteristics of JSX syntax. Weâ€™ll learn that interpolation is not unique to JSX and weâ€™ll learn the limitations and capabilities of interpolation in JSX. With this knowledge, weâ€™ll be more productive using JSX.
