## Notes

- No matter how hard you try, eventually your app code just isnâ€™t going to behave the way you expect it to and youâ€™ll need to handle those exceptions. If a render is thrown and unhandled, your application will be removed from the page, leaving the user with a blank screen... Kind of awkward...

- Luckily for us, thereâ€™s a simple way to handle errors in your application using a special kind of component called an Error Boundary. Unfortunately, there is currently no way to create an Error Boundary component with a function and you have to use a class component instead, but we got another lucky break because thereâ€™s a terrific open source library we can use called react-error-boundary.

- In this lesson, weâ€™ll learn how to write our own simple error boundary and then how to use react-error-boundary instead. Weâ€™ll also learn the implications of where we place our Error Boundaries in our React component tree.
