## Notes

One of the biggest paradigm shifts that React offered to the UI ecosystem was the component model. It allows you to package up all the logic, styling, and layout of a unit of UI into a box that you can easily move around and reuse without exposing any of the implementation details of the component. You donâ€™t have to understand how a component works internally to use it effectively. With idiomatic component architecture, rendering a component in one place wonâ€™t impact other parts of your app.
