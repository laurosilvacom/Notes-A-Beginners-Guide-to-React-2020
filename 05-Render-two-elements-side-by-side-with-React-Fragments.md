## Notes

- In React, you canâ€™t render two React elements side-by-side (<span>Hello</span><span>World</span>). They have to be wrapped in another element (like a `<div>`).
- This may seem like an odd limitation, but when you think about the fact that JSX is compiled to `React.createElement` calls, it makes sense.
- How to side-step this limitation with React Fragments.
