## Notes

- Iâ€™ve built and deployed several applications without downloading or editing a single line of code to my local computer, and I did it with Codesandbox, GitHub, and Netlify (learn more). In this lesson Iâ€™ll show you around some of these tools, and I canâ€™t wait to see what you do with these amazing tools and your new found knowledge of React.
