## Notes

- Application layout is only one part of the user interface equation. Another part is styling. In this lesson weâ€™ll explore the className and style prop for styling our components. This lesson goes much deeper than that. Weâ€™ll learn why className is className and not class (like it is in HTML), and weâ€™ll learn why the style prop accepts an object of camelCase styles rather than a string of css (like it does in HTML). Weâ€™ll take it even further by creating a reusable component that encapsulates these styles and composes the given className and style prop together. Youâ€™re going to love this one.

- Finally, when you actually build a full application, a tool youâ€™ll find invaluable is Tailwind.css.
