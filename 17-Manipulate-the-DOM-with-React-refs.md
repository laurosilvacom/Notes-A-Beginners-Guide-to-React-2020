## Notes

- React is really good at creating and updating DOM elements, but sometimes you need to work with them yourself. A common use case for this is when youâ€™re using a third party library that wasnâ€™t built for or with React specifically. To do this, we need to have some value thatâ€™s associated with our component (like state) to store a reference to the DOM element, but doesnâ€™t trigger re-renders when itâ€™s updated (unlike state). React has something specifically for this and itâ€™s called a ref.

- You create a ref object with the useRef hook and that objectâ€™s current property is the current value of the ref. It can be anything, but if you pass that ref object to a component as a prop called ref, then React will set the current property to the DOM element it creates so you can reference it and manipulate it in your useEffect hook.
