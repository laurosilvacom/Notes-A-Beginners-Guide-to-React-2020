## Notes

- Another piece to the web application puzzle is managing side-effects of our userâ€™s interactions. In this lesson weâ€™ll be interacting with the browserâ€™s localStorage API, but this same thing would apply if weâ€™re interacting with a backend server, or the geolocation API, or anything else that needs to happen when the state of our component changes.

- Youâ€™ll learn how to use Reactâ€™s useEffect hook to manage the side-effect of saving state into localStorage, and also how to re-synchronize our application with the stored value in localStorage. Learn more about viewing localStorage in the Chrome DevTools.
