## Notes

- Often, it can be useful to know what the userâ€™s input is as theyâ€™re typing it and use that information to change what is rendered. This can be good for dynamic search or filter inputs, or triggering changes when a user checks a checkbox, or a myriad of other use cases. In this example, weâ€™re going to dynamically show an error message if the user types something invalid so they donâ€™t have to wait until they submit the form to know theyâ€™re doing something wrong.

- To do this weâ€™ll store the inputâ€™s value in state and then use that state to derive an error message which will be displayed if there is an error.
